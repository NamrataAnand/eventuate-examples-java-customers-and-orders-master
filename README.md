## Building and running using Eventuate Local

First, build the application:

```
./gradlew assemble -P eventuateDriver=local
```

Next, you can launch the application using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

```
export DOCKER_HOST_IP=...
docker-compose -f docker-compose-eventuate-local-<db-type>.yml up -d
```

Where `db-type` is one of:

* `mysql` - use MySQL with Binlog-based event publishing
* `postgres-wal` - use Postgres with Postgres WAL-based event publishing
* `postgres-polling` - use Postgres with generic JDBC polling-based event publishing

Note: You need to set `DOCKER_HOST_IP` before running Docker Compose.
`DOCKER_HOST_IP` is the IP address of the machine running the Docker daemon.
It must be an IP address or resolvable hostname.
It cannot be `localhost`.
See this [guide to setting `DOCKER_HOST_IP`](http://eventuate.io/docs/usingdocker.html) for more information.

Finally, you can use the Swagger UI provided by the services to create customers and orders, and view the order history:

* `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP?}:8081/swagger-ui.html` - Create a customer
* `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP?}:8083/swagger-ui.html` - Create an order
* `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP?}:8082/swagger-ui.html` - View the customer and the order

(Hint: best to open these URLs in separate tabs)

The script `./show-urls.sh` will display the URLs.
